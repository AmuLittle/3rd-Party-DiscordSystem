# 3rd (Party) Discord System
3rd (Party) Discord System is an unofficial port of discord to the 3ds family of systems

<details>
<summary><b>IS THIS LEGAL?!?1!?</b></summary>
<b>No.</b>

Discord's TOS disallows the use of unofficial clients to access their platform. You can use this to discord but I cannot guarentee that you will not get your account deactivated or deleted.
